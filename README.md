#üèΩ Derrick 

Hello üëã I'm Derrick. Transitioning from a successful career as an aircraft mechanic and instructor in the service to the tech world, I bring a wealth of problem-solving skills and first-hand experiences with technology. I am eager to start my new journey as a full-stack software engineer.

With a passion for software development and a drive for excellence, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality and innovative solutions. I'm proficient in Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Java, Django, and React, and I have developed several projects that showcase my ability to develop scalable full-stack applications and demonstrate my ability to design and implement efficient algorithms.

My strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and problem-solving abilities, refined during my service career, have equipped me with the tools necessary to tackle complex software engineering challenges. I am excited to leverage my coding bootcamp education, computer science degree, and hands-on experience to help organizations achieve their goals and drive growth in the industry.

My ability to work collaboratively, lead, educate others, and communicate effectively, combined with my analytical and problem-solving skills, make me a valuable asset to any team. I am eager to join an organization that values growth and innovation, where I can contribute my skills and enthusiasm to drive success.

Feel free to connect with me to learn more about my transition into tech, my projects, or if there are any potential opportunities where I can make significant contributions.
