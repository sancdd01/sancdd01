**`Software Engineer`**

Transitioning from a career in aircraft maintenance✈️🛠, I'm a computer science major working towards entering the software engineering industry. My coding projects so far are reflective of what I've learned from school, as well as a few of my own projects.

 <summary><h3>👨🏾‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I've spent the majority of my CS education working with Java. Now, I'm approaching the end of my degree and am looking to put together a portfolio. I'm feeling, as I imagine many in place have felt, that I did not learn nearly enough from my CS. As such, I began taking courses through UDemy, for web development where I've learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm also teaching myself C++ and Python for some remaining courses I have coming up.  I've found so much more than I expected pursing coding, and I love that everyday I know I have something new and challenging to work towards.
